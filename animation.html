            <figcaption> For this animation project, I chose to represent the emotion of excitement. I used fast motion and bright, bold colors to show how exciting moments can feel intense and full of energy. The star shape was a key part of the design it stands for the burst of excitement and helps grab the viewer’s attention. I made the pacing quick to match the feeling of excitement, which often comes on suddenly and all at once. One of the hardest parts of the project was figuring out how to use the star tool in the software. At first, I couldn’t find it, which was frustrating, but after some trial and error, I managed to get it working. Solving that problem helped me finish the animation and reminded me that creative work often involves a lot of troubleshooting and learning along the way.
