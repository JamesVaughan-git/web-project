                <figcaption> I used Adobe Photoshop to create a soccer arena scene with people playing, inspired by the weekend games I used to have with my friends growing up. This project is a reflection of those memories, capturing the energy and community of those moments. I combined five different images and duplicated the soccer ball image twice to enhance the action in the composition. The most challenging part was finding a suitable background, as many of the images I initially wanted to use had watermarks, but I eventually found one that worked well without compromising the overall look.

I used Adobe Illustrator to create a self-portrait that represents my identity through color and design. I chose blue and white as the background because they are my two favorite colors and help convey a calm, clean look that reflects my personality. The most challenging part of the project was using the Pen Tool to trace my beard accurately, It was a tedious process, but by taking my time and focusing on the details, I was able to successfully complete it. This piece allowed me to express myself creatively while improving my technical skills.
