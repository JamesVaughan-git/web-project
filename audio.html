        <figcaption> For this multimedia project, I chose to recreate the intensity and excitement of an NBA game because basketball has always been a big part of my life and I wanted to bring that energy to life through sound. I used Audacity to layer around 8 different audio samples, including crowd noise, sneaker squeaks, buzzer sounds, and ball dribbles. Instead of real announcer commentary, my friends and I recorded our own play by play to make it more personal and fun. The hardest part was editing the audio, especially timing our commentary and syncing all the sounds to feel realistic, which required a lot of trial and error and careful cutting.
